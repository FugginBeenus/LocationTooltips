A clean, immersive location display system for Minecraft that shows players their current area at the top of their screen. Perfect for servers with shopping districts, themed areas, player shops, and points of interest.

**THIS MOD IS HEAVILY INSPIRED BY THE ORIGIN REALMS LOCATION SYSTEM. THE BASE CONCEPTS ARE NOT MY IDEA, HOWEVER I AM CODING AND CREATING ALL THE ASSESTS.**

I have very little coding knowledge so I am relying on ChatGPT a lot for the basic coding. I would be very open to collaberation, otherwise development will be slow.
